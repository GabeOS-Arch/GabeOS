# GabeOS

**An Arch-based distro forged in the void (Linux). Maintained with duct tape, spite, and love.**

"Finally, I'm proud of you. Anyways go to Gentoo-" [OptimiDev](https://github.com/OptimiDEV)

## 💿 What Is This?

GabeOS is an Arch Linux distro remix with:
- 🖼️ Neofetch showing my ass
- 💀 Calamares installer so you don't have to install it high
- 🔮 Custom themes, splash screens, and more
- 🧠 You've entered hell. Welcome ig

Built from Arch, themed by me, maintained by gremlins.

## 🚀 Features

- Full Arch + Pacman power
- Custom GRUB splash (yeah, we chilling)
- Welcome screen that roasts you if you install it on a Chromebook (Kidding. Mostly). 
- Neofetch shows my **face**, not Fart Linux
- Systemd because fuck you

## 📥 Install

**1. Boot the ISO**  
**2. Calamares GUI will guide you**  
**3. Reboot and say “thanks Gabe”**

(You can also build the ISO yourself if you're chaotic)
