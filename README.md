# GabeOS

**Deal with it. Or not. Your choice.**

"Finally, I'm proud of you. Anyways go to Gentoo-" [OptimiDev](https://github.com/OptimiDEV)

[![Build ISO](https://github.com/GabeOS-Arch/GabeOS-Workflow-Dev/actions/workflows/build-iso.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/GabeOS-Arch/GabeOS-Workflow-Dev/actions/workflows/build-iso.yml)

If this is probably fine if failing. If it's not fine GabeOS is dead and we've transitioned to Slackware.

## 💿 What Is This?

GabeOS is an Arch Linux distro remix with:
- 🖼️ Neofetch showing my ass
- 💀 Calamares installer so you don't have to install it high
- 🔮 Custom themes, splash screens, and more
- 🧠 You've entered hell. Welcome ig

## 🛠️ However... 

You're gonna have to install Hyprland dots, configurations, all by yourself.
I, Gabriel Piss Man, refuse to install dots for you.
It's your own thing. It would be amazingly hard to do it on MY end.
This is why GNOME, is temporarily installed for you. You may UNINSTALL it at any given point in time. It is NOT a requirement.
KDE versions of GabeOS may come out if time aligns.

Built from Arch, made by me, maintained by me (and the 14 people living in my repo).

## 🚀 Features
