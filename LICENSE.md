## TL;DR Legal Jargon (Gabefied Edition):

- üõ†Ô∏è You CAN modify GabeOS. Remix it. Tweak it. Rizz it up. Maybe not that last one but okay
- üôè You MUST credit me (Gabriel) as the original creator. No fake credit scenes. I will end you.
- üõë You CANNOT sell GabeOS or any fork of it. I don‚Äôt care if you put a dark mode on it, no profit-chasing. I'm not gonna sell this either so get real :3 
- ‚ôªÔ∏è You MUST use the **same license** if you share your version. No funny business. Reuse, maybe not repurpose (since this OS is supposed to be Arch but on crack eternally) and don't recycle literally everything here.
- üõë Stop for a moment. You can copy this whole ass thang and make it your own. BUT... butt. You must say this was your own and **fork** this repo so people know you aren't actually the boss here. Sure, KevinOS works ig but dawg you can't just call it your own and call it a day
